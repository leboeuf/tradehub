# TradeHub

TradeHub is an ecosystem of stock market related software I develop in my spare time.

## TradeHub projects

* [QuoteServer](projects/quoteserver)
* [Discovery](projects/discovery)
* [Monitor](projects/monitor)
* [Prospect](projects/prospect)
* [SourceTrust](projects/sourcetrust)

**Note: All queryable components have the ability to output the current server time. This is to keep the components in sync with each other.**
