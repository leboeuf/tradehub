# TradeHub

TradeHub is an ecosystem of stock market related software I develop in my spare time.

## TradeHub projects

* [QuoteServer](projects/QuoteServer.md)
* [Discovery](projects/Discovery.md)
* [Monitor](projects/Monitor.md)
* [Prospect](projects/Prospect.md)
* [SourceTrust](projects/SourceTrust.md)

**Note: All queryable components have the ability to output the current server time. This is to keep the components in sync with each other.**
